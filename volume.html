        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Architecture – How Did You Go About It</strong></h2>
        <p>
            My main goal was to implement the ray marching algorithm which is used for participating media. 
            I used Unity to create scenes with its marketplace helping me download realistic environments 
            (a forest and an icy mountain range). Unity also helped isolate ray marching into just a shader 
            as opposed to me spending time on aspects outside of volumetric ray tracing. The shader composed 
            of two parts, the <code>vert()</code> function that modified the shape of a model and the 
            <code>frag()</code> function that applies color to pixels. All of it was written in ShaderLabs 
            language which is similar to C#. I never used it before so there was kind of a learning curve. 
            Once the shader was built, it was applied to a material that was then applied to an object 
            (in my case a cube).
        </p>

        <h2><strong>System – What You Built to Do It</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Two shaders were made which both apply to cubes and create a sphere by intersecting on the center 
            of the object and a given radius. At first, I used the basic ray marching algorithm and Beer's law 
            to build a homogeneous volume on the screen.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/mediaV/homogeneos.png" alt="Homogeneous Volume">

        <p>
            Then I modified that shader to use Beer's law at multiple steps through the volume to be able to 
            render heterogeneous volumes that have varying density. Perlin's noise was used to emulate the 
            density of the sphere. Another feature that I decided to add outside of the scope of my project 
            was animation. Instead of just a standstill image, I found a way through research to change pixel 
            values by adding the <code>_Time</code> built-in variable to all pixels which constantly moved the 
            volume.

        <p>
            Here you can see me modifying the shader. Absorption allows less light to pass through as it's 
            increased. Noise increases the variation of density throughout. Finally, movement is a flag that 
            turns off or on the animation.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Results – Pretty Pictures</strong></h2>
        <p>Here are the scenes that I created with my ray marching shader.</p>

        <p>
            I also modified the noise function with Fractal Brownian Motion noise and some sine waves to get 
            a more interesting result that emulated northern lights.

        <h2><strong>Future Work – What Would You Do Next</strong></h2>
        <p>
            If I had more time to work on my project I would focus heavily on light interaction. My smoke in 
            the forest fire scenes has no shadows or interaction with the fire underneath it. Also, the 
            northern lights don't emit any light from them, making the mountain range seem dull. Adding 
            scattering and emittance to my ray march shader would fix these issues.
